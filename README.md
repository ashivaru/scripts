Scripts that I use everyday


vbox
====
This is a utility script for starting a VM in headless mode.   It also has the ability to obtain the IP address of the running VM.   You can ssh to the VM without actually quering about the IP address using this script.   It also has much more features.   Just type the command to get a list of supported commands.

alert.sh
=========
A command line alert utility.   It speaks out when the time is up on mac.   It displays the time as it progresses.

setup.sh
=========
A script that I use for setting proxy et al when I am at work.   Also starting tomcat and mongodb.

csv2html.sh
===========
Converts CSV to HTML.   It comes with a style sheet as well (table_styles.css).   The style sheet should be in ~/bin directory, if not update the script.
